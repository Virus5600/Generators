<h1 align="center">The Hub</h1>

The Hub contains all the directories towards all the sub-applications. It acts as the central gateway
towards them and all sub-applications return towards here.

## Contents

As of now, the contents of **The Hub** are two (2) sub-applications under the **"Generator"** categories.

## How to add a sub-application?

Currently, to add a sub-application, you must open the `index.html` and modify its source code.
In the future however, these list will be generated pragmatically using the `resources/index.js`.
